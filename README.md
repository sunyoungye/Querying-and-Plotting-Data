# Crash Data Analysis & Visualization
This project is a Python-based analysis and visualization tool that explores real-world crash data through filtering logic and interactive mapping.

## Overview
The program processes crash data to identify patterns based on conditions such as lighting and vehicle count.
Filtered results are visualized on an interactive map, allowing users to explore crash distributions geographically.

## Key Features
- Data querying and filtering using conditional logic
- String processing to handle real-world dataset fields.
- Interactive map visualization with color-coded markers.
- Clear separation between data processing and visualization logic

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented custom filtering logic to extract meaningful subsets of data
- Used Folium to generate an interactive map-based visualization
- Designed a readable and maintainable data processing flow

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Folium

## How to Run
Download utah_crash_data_2023.csv and DataQuery.py, add both files to a PyCharm project, and run DataQuery.py.
